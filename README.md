# Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Community Starter Kit

Welcome to **abr123** repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through to learn about making your project friendlier for collaboration.

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

Welcome new users with maintainer defined comments the first time your users:
- Create a new issue
- Open a new pull request
- Merge their first pull request
